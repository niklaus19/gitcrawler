gitcrawler
==========

Generates a Mysql database of username, email-id, website address, full name, location, date of joining.

Before running change all the static values in file crawler.py.

Known issues: 	GitHub gives only 1000 results i.e. 100 pages, irrespective of the number of counts, if page 101 is called from script or web it generates 404 error.
		some advance search features don't work properly like order, which needs to be corrected.


Note: This is just initial commit to get the app working, needs to be improved.

Will be improve soon, it's not much to do, just need some spare time.
